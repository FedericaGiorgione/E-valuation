# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: E-valuation

## Overview and planning
Our target population includes professors teaching in high schools in Italy from all different age groups who need to assign homework to their students during this period of online classes. We want to observe how teachers search, create, receive, and evaluate such homework. 



## Observation

### Observation 1
We observed professor 1 while preparing Italian Grammar homework. To perform this action, he took the book and selected the chapter he had explained in the morning, then he chose a list of exercises proposed at the end of the chapter, adding the related pages to study. Then, the professor signed in to the electronic record platform (Classeviva) to upload the assignment. On the homepage, he selected the class and, after that, he clicked on the "Agenda " tool. Through "Agenda", he inserted the exercises he had selected before, adding the due date. \

Professor 1 showed us how a homework page looks like. \
Opportunity: Homework management through an agenda that mimics a physical school diary, divided into days.

### Observation 2 
Professor 2 showed us how exercises are selected on the book and then modified, usually removing tips provided by the author of the book. The observed exercise is an Italian Grammar one and it demanded finding 8 direct objects ("complemento oggetto" in Italian), the indication about the total number was removed. Then he showed us how he adds questions to text analysis homework. After performing these selections, the professor proceeded adding the exercise to the Google classroom platform. He pointed out how the homework delivered are corrected: he reads them one by one and checks the integrity. While he was checking them, he doubted two students copied so he put them side by side and found out they were identical. \

Professor 2 during the observation has found some answers identically between the deliveries of two different students. The check of copy-and-paste between students is not present in the Classroom platform provided by Google, so this is a manual operation performed by him. \
Issue: there is no automatic way to compare stundents' deliverables to check for identical answers.   

### Observation 3
The professor showed us a video recorded during a lesson while he was writing down a list of questions regarding the topics he discussed during the lesson. After that, he told the students to send back the answers in the way they prefer (photos, Word document, etc.) \
Issue: too many platforms/channels to communicate between students and teachers. \

## Interviews

### Set of questions
1. What kind of homework do you find most effective? (quiz, open questions, researches, other) 
2. Where do you find the exercises you assign to students? 
3. How do you assign the homework to your students? 
4. Can you describe to me the evaluation process of such homework? 
5. How do you evaluate the homework?
6. In homework assignment, do you notice more or less involvement from the students? 
7. What online tools and platforms do you use for teaching activities? Tell me some bad/good aspects. Do these tools and platforms satisfy you? 
8. What question didn’t I ask you? 

### Professors answers
Professor 1 answers:
1. I find very helpful exercises from exercise books.
2. I alternate exercises from the book to self-made exercises. Self-made exercises especially for the subject "History", exercises from the book for "Italian Grammar".
3. Through the agenda of the electronic record Classeviva.
4. After choosing the text, I put them on the electronic record Classeviva.
5. I don't assign a mark to homework, but I take into account if someone does not deliver them. I only evaluate written or oral tests.
6. In respect to the last 4-months period, it is slightly better, but comparing to full in presence teaching, it is worst.
7. Classroom through Google Meet. A positive aspect is that this is the only way to make school activities go on. Negative aspects are negative feedback from the students, lack of human interaction, and sociality. Furthermore, students don't take it seriously. Everything needs to be improved.
8. No further questions for me.

Professor 2 answers:
1. Version (translate text) for Latin, Text Analysis for Italian, exercises for Italian Grammar. For literature, I find useful to ask for a presentation of a couple of minutes to explain an argument (ex: one Cantica of Divine Comedy) to avoid copying. The classroom has introduced an academic honesty ("anti-plagio" in Italian) tool to check if homework is copied from the net, but I don't know how it works.
2. I invent them, taking inspiration from books and the web or I take them directly from books.
3. Through classroom or via e-mail.
4. After defining the full text, I write them on the pc and I deliver them with the tools described before.
5. It depends, if I have a class that is not studying enough if they don't deliver them I assign them a negative mark (2/10). If not, I usually don't evaluate them.
6. They are more involved because from Classroom you can see who did deliver and who did not, however, the risk of copying is high. One time a student delivered three Latin versions after 10 minutes, which was very suspicious.
7. Classroom through Google Meet. A lot of tools are available but you don't have control over students copy-and-paste.
8. No further question.

Professor 3 answers:
1. I think that small projects are the best kind of homework but they are hard to manage. Open questions are also good because they let you understand if the student can reformulate learned notions.
2. I have a very good textbook this year so I use that. Last year I took the exercises from the internet and sites specialized in electrical engineering. I sometimes created exercises from scratch based on those found on the internet.
3. Electronic register of ClasseViva.
4. I use feedback from the students. I try to understand their starting level and I assign exercises of increasing difficulty. I stop when students tell me that they are unable to complete an exercise. This is a spontaneous response.
5. I correct most of the homework at home. Students send me their homework in the way they prefer (picture, scan, word document). I correct some of the homework at school to reduce the amount of work at home and to discuss with students and provide better explanations for them. I evaluate the homework with a positive or a negative mark (+ or -) and I use those marks to round off the final grade.
6. Less involvement: some students take advantage of the situation even the most diligent of them. I notice the need for someone to motivate students, especially in this age group where a sense of responsibility is lacking.
7. Last year we used Edmodo and a private platform, the school has this platform because it’s a school for deaf people. This year we’ll use Classroom.
    * Pro: It’s better than email because it is possible to have quicker communication and it is possible to have a discussion.
    * Cons: Total loss of human interaction which is a key factor for evaluation. I think that evaluating students through homework is complicated and it is not possible to encourage the student as there is no immediate feedback on what has been explained. 
    * Classroom and Edmodo work well for theoretical lessons and quizzes but, they are not suitable for the things I think are most interesting for students (for example projects and labs).
8. In technical schools, it is difficult to carry out practical parts (projects and laboratories). This part does not work well. There is simulation software but there is not enough training. We should make this software available to everyone, they are a little difficult.




## User Needs
1. A unique channel to share learning material and to communicate.
2. Avoid students from cheating.
3. Improve social contacts between teachers and students.
4. Feedback from students about homework difficulty.
5. Better support the teacher with the management and the delivery of homework.



## Project Description
This project will be an application helping professors in homework management. Task performed include sending homework to students and receive their solutions back through the platform. Professors will also be able to receive feedback from students about homework difficulty. We decided to pick as target devices smartphones.
