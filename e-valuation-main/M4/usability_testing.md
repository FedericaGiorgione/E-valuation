# Milestone 4: Usability Testing - E-valuation

## Overview and Script

This milestone concerns the usability testing with the target population of our application. Before starting, we create a testing protocol that has to be followed for all the tests. The script is inside this M4 folder and it can be reached directly by clicking [`here`](https://github.com/polito-hci-2020/e-valuation/blob/main/M4/usability_testing_script.pdf). 
The relevant information reported in the script is the following;
* Participants: in this section, we include all the characteristics of our target population;
* Recruitment: how we are looking for users to test our application;
* Equipment: the equipment needed to perform the test. All the tests were performed remotely so all the equipment needed must be owned by the user;
* Artifacts: documents and questionnaires needed to perform the test;
* Initial Script: a brief introduction to the test and the application read by the facilitator before the test;
* Informed consensus document: document the user must read, understand and sign before starting the test. The user must agree on all the sentences, if not the test cannot start;
* Pre-test questionnaire: a set of questions to check if the person interviewed is part of our target population.;
* Post-task questionnaire: we decide to perform the SEQ after each task to test the easiness of each task;
* Tasks list: the list of tasks the user has to perform to complete the test;
* Metrics Used: metrics to evaluate the performance of the user. These metrics are computed for each task.

After the definition of the protocol, we are ready to recruit the users for the test performing the pre-test questionnaire.
We interviewed a total of 4 users, one of them is the one observed in milestone 1 (observation 3). 

## Results and List of Changes

We collected the results of the usability testing in a google sheet file, which is located [`here`](https://github.com/polito-hci-2020/e-valuation/blob/main/M4/results.xlsx).

For every task, we report the following fields: the task completion, the number of critical and non-critical errors and the SEQ answer. Finally, we computed the error-free rate. Furthermore, we report any relevant comments made by the user or observed during the execution of the task. We first analyze users one by one to highlight any critical or good aspects of the application and then we discuss a list of changes to our project.

The different roles (facilitator, observer) were divided in the following way among the team members:
* User 1: Silvia Giammarinaro as facilitator and Daniele Salaris as observer;
* User 2: Valerio Zingarelli as facilitator and Federica Giorgiorne as observer;
* User 3: Federico Giorgione as facilitator and Valerio Zingarelli as observer;
* User 4: Daniele Salaris as facilitator ans Silvia Giammarinaro as observer.

### User 1
User 1 is a 53 years old female math lyceum teacher. The relevant task for user 1 are task 3, 5, 8, let's analyze them one by one. 
* Task 3: she first clicked the image of the homework itself instead of one of the solutions. Then she clicked the info button to understand where the solutions are and she completed the task efficiently. 
* Task 5: trying to use the microphone, she expected a long press button, her comment was "I'm used to WhatsApp, why does it not work?". Unfortunately, this task was not completed: She didn't think a tap could be performed to start the recording. 
* Task 8: to delete the homework she long pressed on the button instead of tapping it once, then she tried to delete the homework from the edit page. After these two trials, she realize a single tap on the delete icon was enough. She came up with the right solution by exclusion.

The photos above referes to tasks 3 and 5. In the first picture the user read carefully the FAQ page to complete the task, instead in the second photo the user is struggling with the use of the microphone.
 
### User 2
User 2 is a 26 years old male electronics high-school teacher. Before facing tasks, during exploration phase, he read FAQ on help page very carefully. Relevant tasks for our analysis are task 2,task 5,task 6 and 7.
* Task 2: he was a bit confused because none of the first visualized students have submitted a solution. After few seconds, he scrolled down and has been able to complete tha task.
* Task 5: He said he would have tried either clicking once to start recording and then click again to stop it or pressing long on the microphone icon before performing the task.
* Task 6: he was confused on where to click to confirm homework's upload. He wandered between little arrows and erase documents button before completing the task in a proper way. 
* Task 7: he modified homework from the preview screen and not from course page.

 </p>

The photos above referes to the exploration phase and to task 6. In the exploration phase he noticed the FAQ page and he read it carefully before starting the test. In task 6 instead he does not know how to save the homework.

### User 3
User 3 is a 44 years old female History and Philosophy teacher. During free exploration phase, she read FAQ. Relevant tasks for our analysis are 2,3,5,7:
* Task 2: none of the first visualized students have submitted a solution, so she read the first two visualized students. They have not submitted a solution but she was sure they were the two who we were asking for. So, in the end, task has not been completed.
* Task 3: she was a little confused but, after few seconds, she has clicked on the filter icon and has been able to complete the task.
* Task 5: she hasn't gone on comment page but tried three times to access to chat from single student's page. After that, she went to comment page and was able to complete the task easily.
* Task 7: she was able to complete task 7 without problems but she clicked on the edit button from homework preview and not from homework box.

The photos above referes to the exploration phase and to task 6. In the exploration phase she downloaded the pdf of the homework and in the second picture she creates an homework.

### User 4
User 4 is a 29 years old male Computer Science teacher. Relevant tasks for our analysis are 2, 3, 5, 6:
* Task 2: Initially, he didnâ€™t find the button to navigate to the solutions page. After some trial, he managed to fulfil the task.
* Task 3: He immediately found the right screen. At first, he clicked on the thumbnail opening the image in another tab and then he came back and clicked the download button.
* Task 5: He tried three times to start the voice message with a long press. In the end, he managed to start the registration.
* Task 6: He tried to upload an image by clicking on the white card two times. It the end, he managed to tap the right button.

The photos above refer to tasks 5 and 6. In the first picture, the user tries to send a voice message with a long press of the recording button. In the second photo, the user tap on empty file card to attach a new file.

### Overall Results
* PRO:
  * FAQ: all the users looked at the FAQ reachable from the home page. In particular user 1 reach them when in need and the others in the exploration phase. So FAQ where used both for help and for prior knowledge before starting the test;
  * Homework list and single preview: simple and intuitive, all users were able to navigate among them, read and understand the relevant information; 
  * Homework form: the input fields were easy to use, instead the file attachment and the save button had some problems (user 2, user 4).
  * Text messages in the chat: all the users were able to correctly send the messages in the chat.
  

* CONS:
  * Voice messages in the chat: the microphone behaviour is misleading for the users. All chat apps have a long press behaviour to start the recording, instead our application has one tap the start the recording and one tap to stop it.
  * Bottom navigation: the navigation was difficult for user 3, maybe the labels used where misleading.
  * File upload: the component for the file preview was misleading for users 2 and 4.
  * Save the homework: the icon for saving the homework was not clear for user 2.


### Potential changes to the project
In the end, we identified some changes to implement. Basing on received feedbacks, we decided to make the following changes:
* FAQ accesible from every page: as we have seen from all the observations, the FAQ was very helpful, so we decided to add the help icon in every page. Before it was reachable only from the home page. The FAQ were mostly used in the exploration phase (users 2, 3, 4) and in task 3 by user 1.
* Microphone long press: to have external consistency with other chat apps, we decided to change the behaviour to register the audio. This change was derived from task 5 and observations of users 1, 3, 4. Furthermore, while pressing the button, we added the text "Recording..." to the text field to give a clear feedback to the user. 
* File preview card: as observed in task 6 performed by user 4, the empty white card before any upload was misleading. We decided to remove it unless there are some photos or files already uploaded.
* Save the homework: as observed in user 2, task 6, the icon to save the button was not clear enough at first sight. So we decided to switch from a right arrow icon to the classic save icon, the one reporting the Floppy. 
* Bottom navigation: as observed in user 2, task 5, the bottom navigation is not clearl enough. We decided to switch the label "Papers" to "Solutions" to refer to the list of solutions provided by the students.
* Student solution table: we decided to change one of the column title due to the task 2 of user 2: we changed "Delivery Date" to "Submission Date".
