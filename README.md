# E-valuation
Project for HCI class at Politecnico di Torino 2020/2021.

During the class we were required to accomplish some tasks representing the milestones of the project. In [`e-valuation-main`](./e-valuation-main) the proposed solutions to such milestones are provided. Moreover in [`e-valuation-code-main`](./e-valuation-code-main) the code for the prototype developed with ReactJS and Firebase has been uploaded.
